Hi ! My name is Lucas [](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)

Full Stack Developer
--------------------

Hey there! I'm Lucas Nascimento Silva — a passionate software developer currently working at American Travel, where I build and maintain internal systems that support business operations in the travel industry.

My current stack includes TypeScript, Svelte, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. I work extensively with SOAP WebService integrations, handling everything from dynamic XML generation to response parsing. I enjoy solving complex problems with clean, efficient code and always strive to deliver solutions that are both scalable and maintainable.

Before that, I spent over 1.5 years at IBM, contributing to the modernization of critical billing systems and integrating external services with Protheus (TOTVS). That experience sharpened my skills in back-end development, secure coding practices, and working with cloud-native environments.

I'm also experienced with Docker and Python, and I continuously look for ways to improve architecture, performance, and developer experience in every project I work on.

Whether it's designing APIs, developing full-stack applications, or integrating legacy systems, I’m all about building impactful, reliable, and future-ready solutions.
Feel free to explore my projects or reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!
